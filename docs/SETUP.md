# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on "project-create-a-comprehensive," a HIPAA-compliant healthcare patient portal.  We will use a combination of Python (backend), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL (database).  Docker is the recommended approach for local development.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * PostgreSQL 14+
    * Docker Desktop (for Docker option)
    * Git

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git client
    * Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)
    * Docker (if using Docker option)
    * Postman (or similar API testing tool)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Highly recommended. Install extensions for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. Configure your linter (e.g., ESLint for frontend, Pylint for backend).
    * **PyCharm (Professional):** Excellent Python IDE with good debugging capabilities.
    * **WebStorm:** Powerful JavaScript IDE with React support.

## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

3. **Development Docker-Compose Configuration:**  The project should include a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file defines the services (database, backend, frontend) and their configurations.  A sample might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
         - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/mydatabase
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The frontend (React) will likely use a tool like `nodemon` or `webpack` to enable hot reloading.  The backend (Python) might use a development server with automatic reloading (e.g., `uvicorn` with appropriate settings).  Instructions for this will be in the project's README.

5. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**  Install PostgreSQL locally. Create a database, user, and password.  Update the database connection string in your environment variables (see below).

## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:** The `.env` file (or similar) will contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and secrets.  Example:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key  # For billing
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid # For SMS
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
   # ... other environment variables ...
   ```

* **Local Development .env File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and populate it with your local development environment variables.  **Never commit this file to version control.** Add it to your `.gitignore`.

* **Configuration for Different Environments:**  Use environment variables to manage settings for development, staging, and production.  Consider using a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, a dedicated configuration service).

## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands for Development:** (Docker): `docker-compose up -d`  (Native):  Start the backend server (e.g., `uvicorn main:app --reload`) and the frontend development server (`npm start` in the frontend directory).

2. **How to Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or your development server).  The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (adjust as needed).

3. **API Documentation Access:**  Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate and host API documentation.

## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:**  Use Git for version control.  Employ a branching strategy like Gitflow (feature branches, develop branch, master branch).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:**  Use linters like Pylint (Python) and ESLint (JavaScript) to enforce consistent code style.  Configure your IDE to automatically run linters.

* **Testing Procedures:**  Implement unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.  Use a testing framework like pytest (Python) and Jest (JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:**  Use your IDE's debugging tools to step through code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.

## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:**  Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for Python, other tools for your database) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:**  Create scripts to populate your database with sample data for development and testing.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Develop scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.

## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  Execute unit tests using your chosen testing framework (pytest, Jest).

* **Running Integration Tests:**  Test interactions between different components of the system.

* **Test Coverage Reports:**  Generate reports to track test coverage and identify areas needing more tests.

## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow the project's API design guidelines.  Write unit and integration tests for new endpoints.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use React's component model.  Ensure proper styling and integration with the backend API.

* **Database Schema Changes:**  Use migrations to manage schema changes.  Update related models and code accordingly.

* **Adding Dependencies:**  Use `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript) to add new dependencies.  Update the project's dependency files accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:**  Refer to the project's README for common issues and solutions.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:**  Change port numbers in your configurations if you encounter port conflicts.

* **Dependency Issues:**  Check your dependency files (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`) and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.  Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

* **Environment Variable Problems:**  Double-check that your environment variables are set correctly and accessible to your application.

## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:**  Follow the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

* **Pull Request Process:**  Create feature branches, write clear commit messages, and submit pull requests for code review.

* **Issue Reporting:**  Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and suggest improvements.  Provide detailed descriptions and reproduction steps.


This guide provides a framework.  The specific commands and configurations will depend on the project's structure and technologies used.  Always refer to the project's README and documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions. Remember to prioritize HIPAA compliance throughout the development process.  Consult with legal and security experts to ensure your application meets all regulatory requirements.
