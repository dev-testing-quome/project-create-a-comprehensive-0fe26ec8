* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development and deployment)
* A PostgreSQL database (for production deployment)


## Installation

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-create-a-comprehensive

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start the application
# Backend (from backend directory)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend (from frontend directory)
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup

1.  **Database Setup:**  Create and configure a PostgreSQL database. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file with your database credentials.
2.  **Build and Run:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/patients`:  (POST) Register a new patient.  (GET) Retrieve a list of patients (requires authentication).
* `/appointments`: (POST) Create a new appointment. (GET) Retrieve a list of appointments for a specific patient (requires authentication).
* `/messages`: (POST) Send a message to a provider. (GET) Retrieve messages for a specific patient (requires authentication).


**Sample Request (POST /patients):**

```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```


**Common Workflows:**

1.  **Patient Registration:**  Users register via the `/patients` endpoint, providing necessary information.
2.  **Appointment Scheduling:**  Patients can schedule appointments via the `/appointments` endpoint, selecting a date and time from available slots.
3.  **Secure Messaging:**  Patients and providers can exchange messages using the `/messages` endpoint, ensuring HIPAA compliance.
